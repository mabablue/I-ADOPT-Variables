A low GDOP corresponds to an optimal geometric configuration of radar stations, and results in accurate surface current data. Essentially, GDOP is a quantitative way to relate the radial and velocity vector uncertainties. Setting a threshold on GDOP for total combination avoids the combination of radials with an intersection angle below a certain value. GDOP is a useful metric for filtering errant velocities due to poor geometry.",{"@type":9,"@id":11,"label":12,"comment":-1},[10],"https://w3id.org/iadopt/ont/Property","https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S06/current/S0600265/","dilution of precision",{"@type":14,"@id":18,"label":19,"comment":-1,"hasPart":20},[15,16,17],"https://w3id.org/iadopt/ont/Entity","https://w3id.org/iadopt/ont/System","https://w3id.org/iadopt/ont/SymetricSystem","http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S29/current/PE001307/","relative position",[21,25],{"@type":22,"@id":23,"label":24,"comment":-1},[15],null,"position of receiver",{"@type":26,"@id":23,"label":27,"comment":-1},[15],"position of transmitters",[],[],{"Waste-Water":31,"Ocean - HFR":41,"EnvironmentalChemistry":80,"Challenge":86},[32,37],{"title":33,"comment":34,"path":35,"section":36},"Circulation-Method-in-Tube","Circulation method (gravity, forced, ...) of water in canalisation pipe","Waste-Water/CirculationMethod-Water.ttl","Waste-Water",{"title":38,"comment":39,"path":40,"section":36},"State of connection pipe","State (faulty, cracked, ... ) of pipe connection in plastic with a diametre of 30 cm.","Waste-Water/StateOfPipeConnection.ttl",[42,47,51,55,59,60,64,68,72,76],{"title":43,"comment":44,"path":45,"section":46},"DRVA Direction of radial velocity of water current relative to instrument and to True North by high frequency radar","The compass direction in degrees positive clockwise from TrueNorth of the component of water velocity in a water body along radial lines centered at the HFR antenna.","Ocean - HFR/DRVA.ttl","Ocean - HFR",{"title":48,"comment":49,"path":50,"section":46},"ESPC Radial velocity (away from) standard deviation over the scatter patch of water current relative to instrument in the water body by high frequency radar","Standard deviation of the component of water velocity in a water body along radial lines centered at the HFR antenna, evaluated over the scatter patch","Ocean - HFR/ESPC.ttl",{"title":52,"comment":53,"path":54,"section":46},"ETMP Radial velocity (away from) standard deviation of water current relative to instrument in the water body by high frequency radar","Standard deviation of the component of water velocity in a water body along radial lines centered at the HFR antenna, evaluated over the coverage period","Ocean - HFR/ETMP.ttl",{"title":56,"comment":57,"path":58,"section":46},"EWCT Eastward velocity of water current in the water body by high frequency radar","Component of the sea surface current velocity that is directed eastward (positive values) or westward (negative values)","Ocean - HFR/EWCT.ttl",{"title":6,"comment":7,"path":1,"section":46},{"title":61,"comment":62,"path":63,"section":46},"HCSS Radial velocity variance of water current relative to instrument  in the water body by high frequency radar","Variance of the component of water velocity in a water body along radial lines centered at the HFR antenna, evaluated over the coverage period","Ocean - HFR/HCSS.ttl",{"title":65,"comment":66,"path":67,"section":46},"NSCT Northward velocity of water current in the water body by high frequency radar","Component of the sea surface current velocity that is directed northward (positive values) or southward (negative values)","Ocean - HFR/NSCT.ttl",{"title":69,"comment":70,"path":71,"section":46},"RDVA Radial velocity (away from) of water current relative to instrument in the water body by High Frequency Radar","Component of the sea surface current velocity that is directed toward (negative values) or away from (positive values) the High Frequency Radar (HFR) antenna, measured along the lines of sight of the antenna, i.e. along radial lines centered at the HFR antenna.","Ocean - HFR/RDVA.ttl",{"title":73,"comment":74,"path":75,"section":46},"UVAD Eastward velocity average in the water by a moored acoustic doppler current profile (ADCP)","UVAD (m s-1) - ADCP datafile","Ocean - HFR/UVAD.ttl",{"title":77,"comment":78,"path":79,"section":46},"VART_QC Variance quality flag","QC flags labelling surface velocity vectors whose temporal variance is smaller than a maximum variance threshold with a “good data” flag.
